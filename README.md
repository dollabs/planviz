1. Install [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) Server
 * For Debian GNU/Linux systems simply do

   `# apt-get install rabbitmq-server`

1. Install [boot](https://github.com/dollabs/plan-schema#building).
   Please note the steps to install **boot.properties** and **profile.boot**
   to your `~/.boot/` directory (so that the cider deftask is available).

   $
   ````

2. Clone and install [plan-schema](https://github.com/dollabs/plan-schema)

   ````
   $ mkdir -p ~/src/github/dollabs
   $ cd ~/src/github/dollabs
   $ git clone https://github.com/dollabs/plan-schema

5. Clone and build **planviz** (_NOTE:_ you may see various warnings
like `WARNING: Use of undeclared Var planviz.components/x21694 at line 42`
that do not prevent building)

   ````
   $ cd ..
   $ git clone https://github.com/dollabs/planviz
   $ cd planviz
   $ boot build-jar
   ````

6. Run the demo
  * *NOTE* this config uses the example plans from **plan-schema**
  * For convenience you may add the [planviz/bin](bin) directory to your `PATH`
(or simply refer to the startup script as `./bin/planviz`).
  * Note that the single argument to `planviz FOO` refers to a configuration file
    with details in `config/FOO.edn`.

   ````
   $ planviz demo
   ````

7. After you see `PLANVIZ server ready` you can open a (or several) browser windows to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
